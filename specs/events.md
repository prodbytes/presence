# Events

- Events appear in a vertically scrolling timeline, newest at the top. Each
  entry is just a card, with no dot or rail beside it, and cards are 8 px
  apart.
- Each event card shows an icon, a title, an optional detail line and the time
  (HH:mm:ss). Event types can supply their own card (`AppEvent.buildCard`);
  `ClipRequested` does.
- When a new event arrives, the timeline scrolls back to the top to show it.
- On launch, the app pushes an **Application started** event.
- With no events, the panel shows a "No events" empty state.
- Events flow through an app-wide **event bus**: a plain Dart broadcast
  `StreamController` (`AppEventBus` in
  [lib/events.dart](../presence_app/lib/events.dart)). Any widget can publish
  with `AppEventBusScope.of(context).publish(event)`, and any number of
  listeners can subscribe to `bus.stream`.
- The bus keeps no history. `EventLog` subscribes to it at startup and holds
  the history the timeline shows. The app owns both, above `MaterialApp`, so
  every screen and route can reach the bus. The startup event is published
  only after `EventLog` subscribes; otherwise it would be dropped.
